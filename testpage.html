	<div>Ex-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly paid unnamed former senior European politicians to lobby for Ukraine's previous pro-Russia government, a new indictment filed by special counsel Robert Mueller says.

Mr Manafort paid over €2m ($2.5m; £1.8m) to the ex-politicians, it says.

He has maintained his innocence in the face of Mr Mueller's investigations.

Mr Trump's ex-deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, has admitted conspiracy and lying to investigators in a plea deal.

Mr Mueller is investigating claims of Russian political meddling in the US.

There are no allegations that either man colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, which is the main thrust of the justice department investigation.</div>
